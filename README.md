# Text-genration-model
This text generation model is trained on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, a compact corpus of Shakespeare's plays and dialogues consisting of approximately 1 million characters. The model learns the stylistic and linguistic patterns of Elizabethan English, enabling it to generate text that mimics Shakespearean dialogue and structure.
